# StickerSmash

StickerSmash is a application I have created using expo's documentation for react native introduction. This applicaiton carries out my existing React knowledge and allow me to create mobile compatible application with cool components.

## What learned

<Pressable> component to handle touch interactions. Its part of core React Native library. I used it in Button.js to trigger onPress fuction and customized style prop.

```bash
props : onPressIn, onPressOut, onLongPress.
```

<Modal> component to handle emoji on top of existing image.

```bash
props : visible, animationType, transparent.
```

<View> component to handle styling.

#

And many other core react-native components..
